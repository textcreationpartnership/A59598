            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>OUr Saviour Chriſts negative <hi>ab initio non fuit ſic, Mat.</hi> 19.8. was a full confutation of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees miſtake in the caſe of Divorcement; and the affirmative, <hi>ab initio fuit ſic,</hi> is here the Apoſtles confirmation of his former theſes, and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the one <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.38. the other in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verſe the firſt, which though it be not expreſſed, is virtually implyed; the whole Fabrick of his diſcourſe beares on that foundation; and all the ſubſequent examples, are but ſo many Morall evidences and demonſtrations of thoſe holy truths: And that they were ſo from the beginning, he fetcheth his proofes from the beginning of Piety; all your forefathers lived by Faith, Faith was to them the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen; and therefore if you be Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, your Faith will give you life, alſo will be to you the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, &amp;c. From the beginning of the World till this preſent Century, you may be furniſhed with faire Preſidents to verifie theſe truths for your ſatisfaction, and to exemplifie them to you for your obſervation: thoſe primitive ſpirits (if your ſpirits be teachable and pliant) will learn you the doctrines and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith, will leave on your Soules a perſwaſion of the truth of thoſe truths, and alſo work on your ſpirits an habituall attendance on God, and reſignation of your ſelves to God, and a conformity to his holy will: In briefe, Their Piety will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you what and how to beleeve; begin with the World,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30648:3"/>and fetch your proofes downewards, and you ſhall finde the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to beleeve the Propoſitions, both in <hi>theſi</hi> and <hi>hypotheſi;</hi> they embraced them for truthes, and applyed them to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall uſes, both by active and paſſive obedience, even before men began to call upon God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. that is, in ſolemne Aſſemblies, and Publique manner to worſhip God; you have this exemplified in <hi>Abel,</hi> the firſt Patterne of patience, and practioner of Piety; the firſt Martyr and Canonized Saint, whoſe Faith engaged him to Sacrifice, to preſent this Sacrifice to God; and becauſe an Oblation to God, therefore a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sacrifice it was; and for this Act he was approved by God, and is famous with men; both God and Man to this day ſpeaks of him with honourable Titles. <hi>Abel</hi> the Juſt, <hi>Abel</hi> the Righteous, By Faith offered, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Method I ſhall obſerve in this and the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, will be one and the ſame, and ſo throughout I ſhall endeavour,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To explain, and deliver the ſenſe of the Text, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Hiſtory from whence the Words of the Text are taken.</item>
                  <item>2. To propoſe ſuch Doctrinall inferences, and practicall deductions, as I ſhall obſerve and conclude from the Text.</item>
                  <item>3. To provoke your Devotion with a Prayer and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the chiefeſt obſervable in the Text, or that which was principally entended by the holy Apoſtle.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By Faith:</hi> The Offering was the preſcript and injunction of Faith, not <hi>actus elicitus fidei,</hi> for the proper and immediate Act of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is beliefe; but <hi>actus imperatus,</hi> an Act which iſſued from beliefe and was commanded by it; Thus viſiting the Fatherleſſe and Widdow, <hi>Jaw.</hi> 1.27. as an ingredient in the Apoſtles deſcription of pure Religion; not as this were an Act of Religion, in the moſt ſtrict reſtrained ſenſe, as Religion, is the duty of adoration, not as it ſignifies, the performance of the direct and proper offices of his honour and worſhip, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his perfections, magnifying him in his Attributes; or having familiar entercourſe with him; but in a more large extended ſenſe, as it is an inſeparable adjunct, or convincing argument
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30648:3"/>of Religion, without which, no man can juſtly pretend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or be denominated Religious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He offered to God a Sacrifice;</hi> This Law of Sacrificing was <hi>ab initio,</hi> of long ſtanding in the Church of God; the firſt man, without doubt, and the firſt holy men practiſed it, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Ordinances, ſacrificiary was an inſtitution of Piety; 'Tis true, we Reade not of <hi>Adams</hi> Sacrificing, perhaps becauſe no ſuch notable occurrent happened therein, as in the Oblations of his Sons; yet that he practiſed and taught his ſons this duty, may with much probability be aſſerted; Nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, taught him this Law, in as much, as the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heatheniſh ſpirits, with an unanimous conſent, have Voted it an Honour due to God, and did preciſely obſerve it, as is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Abel</hi> not onely offered a Sacrifice; but its noted, for an excellent Sacrifice, <hi>a more excellent Sacrifice then</hi> Cains; a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there was betwixt their Sacrifices, and a great one too; there was excellency, greatneſſe in the one, <hi>obtulit majorem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiam,</hi> ſo <hi>Beza, Plurimam,</hi> ſo the old Tranſlation Reades it; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; ſo the Originall: there was no excellency, nor greatneſſe in the other, for it was rejected.</p>
               <p>Interpreters have travelled long to enquire wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice conſiſted, and to diſcover the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Oblations, and to finde a reaſon, why God accepted <hi>Abels,</hi> diſapproved <hi>Cains</hi> Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>I ſhall acquaint you with ſome of their diſcoveries, and will not preſume to determine, which are reall, which imaginary; perhaps they are all imperfect; neither dare I preſcribe to others, but deſires of them a Travellers indifferencie, to chooſe what they finde ſafeſt: onely I ſhall enterpoſe this conſideration, That God is no reſpector of Perſons, his judgements are in the deep, and his wayes paſt finding out; and though his judgements are many times ſecret, yet they alwaies proceed upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rules of juſtice and equity; and where our reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde out an unqueſtionable reaſon of his procedures, yet it is all the reaſon in the World, to beleeve and acknowledge God to be moſt wiſe, moſt juſt, moſt holy. But this in generall, though it will not ſilence a proud cavilling diſputant, will yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30648:4"/>ſatisfie a ſober modeſt Chriſtian; That <hi>Cains</hi> prophaneneſſe, or hypocriſie, or preconceived hatred of his Brother, ſpoyled the Religion of his Sacrifice, and deprived him of the reward of his ſervice; and that <hi>Abels</hi> innocency, ſincerity, and devotion, was as incenſe to his ſacrifice, as Fire from Heaven to hallow it, to give it a ſweet ſmelling ſavour; and in this reſolution there can be no danger: I am ſure it is according to the plain rule of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; peruſe theſe following Texts, and apply them,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21.22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. and 21.27. <hi>Iſap</hi> 66.3. <hi>Am.</hi> 5.21.</p>
               <p>But to return, The Jews derive the excellency of <hi>Abels</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from it ſelfe, the matter offered, or ſubject of the offring; which (ſay they) was according to the rule and eſtimate of things prisable, of more value then <hi>Cains:</hi> and the Crime which they charge on <hi>Cain,</hi> was Covetouſneſſe: the Virtue they aſcribe to <hi>Abel,</hi> was Liberality. 'Tis true, God loves a giver like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, liberall and bountifull; the Covetous (whoſe almes, if he give any, is in <hi>Senica's</hi> Phraſe, <hi>Panis lapidoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e,</hi> and whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for Gods ſervice, or Temple, are Seſſes, not Free-will Offerings) God abhors: yet it alſo as true, which the Heathen hath obſerved, God regardeth not how full hands we bring him, but how pure: he values not our Offerings, becauſe they are either many, or rich; but becauſe they be holy: reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Ariſt. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Aeth. c</hi> 1. But yet this comes not home, is no full diſcovery; for though it be moſt certain, That covetouſneſſe is an abomination, a filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe able to pollute any ſacrifice, or holy duty; and that Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is highly prized and rewarded by the Almighty: yet 'its evident from the Text, That their Offerings were of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent returnes with which God had bleſſed their labours, in their reſpective civill Callings and conditions of life: and therefore, in reſpect of this difference, the reaſon lies not of their different reſpect with God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Death is the wages of ſin, not the reward of piety; and his taking away, in the Text, is ſubſequent to his walking with God, as an extraordinary remuneration thereof, and a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall teſtimony of his love and favour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. No ſuch phraſe is uſed concerning the departure of any of the reſt of the Patriarches; of all of them it is ſaid in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe formall termes, that they dyed, of him onely, <hi>that God tooke him,</hi> in an extraordinary favour, by an extraordinary way; neither is this to be preſumed a nullity, or appeal of that eternall Decree of the Soveraigne Lawgiver, <hi>Statutum eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus mori,</hi> but a diſpenſation of that Law, which he ſubjected his creatures unto, himſelfe ſtill remaining moſt free to privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and exempt whom he pleaſeth from the bondage of death, and ſentence of the Law; neither doth Death in that Statute ſignifie onely the divorce or ſeparated eſtate of the ſoule from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30648:13"/>the body, but alſo it expreſſeth the exchange of a mortall bodily condition, into an immortall and ſpirituall: and unleſſe this ſignification be admitted, that Statute reacheth not, holdeth not, in that reſidue which ſhall be found at the laſt day, who ſhall not die that is their perſons ſhall not be diſſolved, but ſhall die, they ſhall be changed; they ſhall not die in the former, they ſhall die in the latter ſenſe 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That expreſſion [he was not, or he was not ſeen] <hi>non com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paruit,</hi> as <hi>Onkelos,</hi> imports ſo much For if God had onely aſſumed his ſoule, as of other dying Saints, he might have been ſeen on earth, his body had remained among them as the dead bodies of <hi>Abel, Seth, &amp;c.</hi> did; which becauſe it was not to be found, we may with good conſequence infer, God took it with his ſoule, not his ſoule, and left it.</p>
               <p>If it be objected That it is alſo ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> his body that it was not to be found; the anſwer is obvious, that the caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> different: For of <hi>Moſes</hi> its recorded in plain termet, <hi>that he died</hi> they are the very words of the Text, no ſuch thing ſo much as hinted concerning <hi>Enoch:</hi> And although none had made a diſcovery where <hi>Moſes</hi> Sepulchre was, the proper <hi>ubi</hi> of it, yet in generall we know, God enterred him in a valley of Moab, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God is a God of the living; what he is ſaid to take, it is to ſhew mercy and love, it is not to worſe, but perfect the condition: if he take the ſoule, it is to enlarge it from the burden and bondage of the body, and to compleat that effence which it had in its houſe of Clay: if he take the body, it is to confer on it a more excellent and certain condition, to free it from contingencies, infirmities, yea corruption it ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to a life proportionable to that dignity and glory it is aſſumed and advanced unto.</p>
               <p>Others there are, who though they grant, he died not, yet by no means will allow him a place in Heaven, but confine him to ſome ſubterreſtriall or aeriall lodge, or which is moſt received, to Paradiſe, as (ſay they) afterwards <hi>Elias</hi> was, there to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the revelation of Antichriſt, at, or neer, the end of the World, under whom they ſhall ſuffer Martyrdome, yet at laſt ſhall prevaile againſt him, and ſo be admitted into Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:30648:13"/>
               <p>But this fancy is eaſily conſuted by the ſeries of the hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> for either <hi>Enoch</hi> was one of the eight perſons ſaved in the Deluge, as moſt certain it is he was not; or if he were at the time of the Deluge in any <hi>terra incognita,</hi> he had certainly periſhed in it. If it be replied, That Paradiſe was a priviledged place, by an extraordinary diſpenſation, from the generall Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Firſt this is to beg the queſtion, and to ſuppoſe that which is to be proved. Secondly, this is to pretend a miracle without warranty. Thirdly, if it were ſo, then <hi>Noah</hi> might have ſaved himſelfe a labor to build an Arke, and ſaved himſelfe and children in Paradiſe, and have had no tedious march thither. And fourthly, if <hi>Enochs</hi> body were there, it might have been found, and ſeen, for it was a known place in Meſopotamia; and <hi>Peter,</hi> the Jeſuit is of this opinion, and diſſents from <hi>Bell,</hi> and others of his ſociety in this particular.</p>

Had <hi>Abraham</hi> gone upon a ſullen humour of diſcontent, or a doting fancy of change, or a pure pang of over-growne Zeale, the Enterprize had been folly, ſuperſtition, and impiety, and which is more, infidelity: had he gone without permiſſion, or competent authority, it had been temerity and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not worſe, ſedition. Had he gone upon the ſcore of a new diſcovery, and pretence of a forraine Plantation, this had beene credulity and deſigne; or had he gone upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or narrative of the fertility of the Land of Canaan, this at the beſt, would be interpreted, but an innocent undertaking; it were farre from being an act of Divine Faith.

For, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Rebekah</hi> as little minded the Divine Oracle, as her Husband; inaſmuch as the Scripture makes this the reaſon of her affection, that <hi>Iacob</hi> was a plaine man, and lived in Tents, was a comrade to her, and frequently
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30648:67"/>converſed with her, (and converſation is the laſt concoction of love) which <hi>Eſau</hi> did not, being alwayes abroad; and ſo this affection of her, was an effect of the ſame infirmity; it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not from any rationall ſolid cauſe, but from a conceited ſenſitive endearement: Yet her affection ſtayes not here, <hi>Daw uno abſurde, ſequuntur mille,</hi> it carries her on to a deſigne which would comply with and gratifie her paſſion; and now the plot is to advance her beloved Son, and out <hi>Eſau</hi> of his Fathers bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And for this purpoſe, ſhe contrives an artificiall lye, but notorious fallacy, <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt goe to his Father, now blinde, and therefore more apt to be deceived and pretend himſelfe to be his Firſt-borne <hi>Eſau;</hi> that he had been a hunting for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Veniſon, which now he preſented to him; and upon this account, he muſt demand the bleſſing of Primogeniture. When once paſſion rules us, and intereſt perſwades us, how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and reſtleſſe are we to ſatisfie our paſſions, and purſue our intereſts, without any reſpect to either humane or divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; Lawes then have no obligingneſſe in them, and ſo ſtrongly doe theſe carnalities carry us, that we ſtop not, till either we carry all before us, like a violent torrent; or runne our ſelves into miſchieſes as wilde beaſts into a ſnare in the purſuance of their prey. But above all, this moſt plainely appears, in this plaine man <hi>Iacob,</hi> who for all his ſeeming ſimplicity, hath one tricke of Legerdemaine, he will <hi>act</hi> that part, which his Mother had given him to conne though he knew his part was none of the beſt, and her counſell ſtark naught: for that he ſuppoſed that this artifice deſerved rather a curſe, then a bleſſing, we may gueſſe from his own words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.12. but, <hi>qua data porta ruunt: Ahab</hi> is never quiet till he purchaſe <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, though the poſſeſſion of it be death. And <hi>Iacob</hi> is eaſily perſwaded by his Mother to follow the plot, becauſe he liked it, and it made for him; and now her motions are moſt chearefully entertained and accepted, and obſerved. How often doth ſelfe-love betray us, and our temporall intereſts ſtifle and extinguiſh the propoſals of Reaſon and Religion!
